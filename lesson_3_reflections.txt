When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
     When you want to share files with a team so that they can contribute too.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    Because there might be times that you don't want your files overwritten locally and you want to time the pulls out.
